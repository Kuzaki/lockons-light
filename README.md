lockons light
-------

Instant lockons regardless of ping.

Caches server responses regarding whenever it is possible or not to lockon onto someone with a heal or attack skill. So your first locking on would work with your usual latency delay, but all the rest would be instant.

Unlike original instant-lockons it avoids such things as showing that it is possible to lock onto untargetable things like ballistas or other objects.

+Note that you will still have skill delayâ€”that is, there is still a delay
between when you initiate a skill and when your client registers it. However,
once you have entered lockon mode, you should get instant lockons.
